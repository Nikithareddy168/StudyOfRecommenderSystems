Model based collaborative filtering algorithms finds the low rank matrices from the incomplete rating matrix.
They generate the recommendations by approximately constructing fully specified rating matrix from the low rank matrices.

This repo contains SGD and ALS implementations to find low rank matrices and construct a fully specified rating matrix.
